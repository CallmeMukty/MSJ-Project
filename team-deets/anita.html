          <h2>The Health Data Scientist</h2>
          <p>
            Anita is a health researcher with over three years of experience in
            health data science and program management. Her expertise extends to
            digital health, where she has mentored young statisticians and
            software engineers, led teams in developing web-based dashboards,
            and utilised data analysis to inform evidence-based decision-making
            in health. She holds a BSc. in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and is
            currently reading for an MSc. in International Health and Tropical
            Medicine as a MasterCard Foundation scholar at the University of

          <h2>The Digital Mentor</h2>
          <p>
            While pursuing an undergraduate program in Kenya, which was very new
            at the time, Anita faced a lack of understanding from many about
            what she was studying, its potential, and the career options it
            offered. This prompted her to seek out mentors online, where she
            appreciated the power of sharing experiences for others to learn
            from. This experience motivated her to join MSJ and actively use her
            social media platforms which have a current collective following of
            ~50,000, to advocate for the integration of data science in health
            and provide guidance on educational opportunities.
