          <p>
            Ruth Nanjala is a dedicated leader shaping impactful initiatives
            across the globe. Ruthâ€™s multifaceted contributions underscore her
            commitment to mentorship, education, and community building. Ruth is
            the founder of the 'My Science Journey' (MSJ) webinar series.
            Through the MSJ platform, established scientists are invited to
            share their science narratives, thus offering mentorship to inspire
            and guide young scientists towards careers in science. As the
            inaugural AfOx Kennedy Trust Prize Studentship Scholar, she is
            currently pursuing a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Medicine at the
            University of Oxford..

          <h2>The Founder</h2>
          <p>
            Mentorship has been pivotal in my personal development, shaping my
            journey and growth. To pay this forward and support others, I
            founded MSJ, a platform dedicated to mentorship in the scientific
            community. Recognizing that the path in science is often nonlinear
            and multifaceted, I established MSJ to offer diverse perspectives
            and insights into scientific careers. Through MSJ, individuals can
            network, collaborate, and connect with mentors who share their
            interests, fostering professional growth and development.
